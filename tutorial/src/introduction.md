# Introduction

The [Cellumina library] is a library that allows  users to easily create, modify and run [cellular automata] rust.

[cellular automata]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton

In this book, we will discuss some basic properties and principles of cellular automata as well as the structure and usage of the Cellumina library. We will finish with a plethora of different examples.
These examples explore features of Cellumina as well as interesting cellular automata, so they should be interesting (or at least entertaining) if you do not care too much about the library itself.
